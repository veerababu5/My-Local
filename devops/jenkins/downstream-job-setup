>> When Job A trigger needs to Trigger Job B as a down stream job, and needs to Set Conditions like.

While Triggering A Job User input needs to Provide Yes or No to trigger B Job. [ current service requires Release Tag then select Yes or else No ]

Step 1: Need to set Active Choice Parameter in A Job Configuration.
Name : Releasetag
Script:
  Groovy Script:
      return[
      'Yes'
      'No'
      ]
Fallback Script
  Groovy Script
      return['error']
      
Choice Type : Select what ever you want Check Box or single select or Multi select.

      
      Once we have configurued Active Choice parameters in Job Configuration Next Need to add stage in Pipeline.
      
 Step 2: Add Stage in A Job Pipeline Script.
 
 stage('post-build'){
     if ( "${Releasetag}" == "Yes" )
     {
         echo 'Running Release Automation pipeline'
           build job: 'release-automation-poc', parameters: [string(name: 'ProjectName', value: "${ProjectName}")]
      }
      else if ( "${Releasetag}" == "No" )
      {
           echo 'Release Tag Not Selected for this Service'
       }
       
  }
  
  
  This how we can trigger Down stream Job along with conditions.
